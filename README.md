# TeleICU
TeleICU, also known as Tele-intensive care unit, refers to the use of telemedicine technologies to provide critical care services remotely. This system allows healthcare professionals, particularly intensivists and critical care nurses, to monitor and manage ICU patients from a distance.
It uses videos of the ICU to detect motion of the patient and provide the information to the hospital staff.
